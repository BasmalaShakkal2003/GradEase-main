The project introduces GradEase, a mobile application designed to streamline and enhance 
the management of graduation projects for students and faculty members. It tackles common 
challenges such as poor communication, missed deadlines, lack of proper guidance, and 
project duplication by offering a centralized, user-friendly platform. Key features include 
AI-powered topic suggestions, plagiarism detection, milestone tracking, real-time messaging, 
and task management. GradEase empowers students to work more independently and efficiently 
while enabling supervisors to monitor progress, provide timely feedback, and ensure academic 
integrityâ€”ultimately improving the graduation project experience for all stakeholders.
