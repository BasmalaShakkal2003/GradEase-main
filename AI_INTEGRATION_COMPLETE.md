String comparison = await ProjectEvaluator.checkPlagiarism(project1, project2);
// Returns intelligent similarity analysis between two projects
```

## üîë API Key Configuration

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-gemini-api-key"
```

### Option 2: Direct Configuration
```dart
// Modify _apiKey constant in lib/AI/check_eval.dart
static const String _apiKey = 'your-actual-gemini-api-key';
```

### Getting an API Key
1. Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Create new API key
4. Configure in your application

## üõ°Ô∏è Robust Fallback System

The system includes intelligent fallback capabilities:

### With API Key
- **Full Gemini AI Analysis**: Professional-grade evaluation
- **Contextual Understanding**: Intelligent concept analysis
- **Detailed Explanations**: Clear reasoning for scores

### Without API Key  
- **Basic Text Analysis**: Functional evaluation system
- **Word-based Comparison**: Simple similarity detection
- **Helpful Guidance**: Clear instructions for AI setup

## üìä Sample AI Output

### Project Evaluation Response
```
Total Percentage: 78%

- Grammar: 85% - Mostly correct; a few subject-verb agreement errors
- Spelling: 95% - Very few spelling errors observed
- Vocabulary: 70% - Adequate but could be more sophisticated
- Clarity: 75% - Generally understandable with some complex sections
- Coherence: 80% - Logical flow maintained with minor transition issues
- Diagram Relevance: 90% - Diagrams effectively represent concepts
- Diagram Clarity: 65% - Some overcrowding and small font issues
- Diagram Accuracy: 85% - Technically correct with minor labeling improvements needed
- Diagram Integration: 70% - Good correlation but could be better explained
```

### Plagiarism Detection Response
```
The projects have a 15% similarity.

Similar Points:
- Both projects operate within the healthcare domain
- Both include blood donation components
- Both aim to improve communication and coordination

Explanation: The 15% similarity arises from overlapping healthcare context 
and shared blood donation features. While projects have similar components, 
their overall scope and functionalities differ significantly.
