Technology: Ethereum, Solidity, React.js, IPFS, MongoDB
Features: Smart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, multi-signature verification
Innovation: Privacy-preserving credential verification system
''';

final evaluation = await ProjectEvaluator.evaluateProject(project);
// Returns detailed blockchain-specific technical analysis
```

## üîë API Configuration

### Environment Variable Setup:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-gemini-api-key"
```

### Getting API Key:
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create new API key
3. Set environment variable
4. Restart application

### Fallback Mode:
- **Enhanced Technical Analysis**: 20+ helper methods for offline evaluation
- **Technology Detection**: Identifies tech stacks without AI
- **Academic Assessment**: Graduation project specific criteria
- **Grade Estimation**: Based on technical complexity analysis

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

### Technical Score Calculation:
```dart
{
  'overall': 85,           // Total score out of 100
  'depth': 22,            // Technical depth (max 25)
  'scope': 18,            // Project scope (max 20)
  'problem': 19,          // Problem definition (max 20)
  'architecture': 14,     // Architecture design (max 15)
  'documentation': 8,     // Documentation quality (max 10)
  'academic': 9,          // Academic standards (max 10)
  'complexity': 4         // Complexity level (1-5)
}
```

### Grade Mapping:
- **A+ (85-100)**: Outstanding graduation project
- **A (75-84)**: Strong graduation project
- **B+ (65-74)**: Solid project with improvements needed
- **B (55-64)**: Adequate but requires enhancement
- **C+ (Below 55)**: Major improvements required
